    <p>Over the past two years, my design journey has pivoted toward sustainable design, by joining the iHOG research team led by Jack Brandsma and acquiring an internship position at Studio Tjeerd Veenhoven. Not only do I think it is crucial for designers of our generation to be conscious about the things we create, but I also find material research to be extremely interesting. The innovative minds of those who come up with recipes using a mix of raw and intricate ingredients, with endless possibilities, almost like an alchemist mixing potions in their cauldron. But here is the plot twist â€“ the more I delve into material research, the more I face a dilemma. Taking care of one thing may lead to the sacrifice of another. The heart of the matter lies in the challenge of balancing competing priorities. While organic farming could replace conventional agricultural practices, it might not sustainably feed the global population. This dilemma brings me to research further on the interesting tension between taking care and manipulation.</p>
