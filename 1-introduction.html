      <p>I was born in the vibrant landscapes of Taiwan. Yet the concept of a fixed home remained difficult to pin down, as my family embarked on a journey, weaving through different countries and cultures. From busy cities to calming landscapes, the world became my canvas, each place leaving me with a new stamp in the book of my identity.</p> 
      <p>My parents recognized the value of exposing their children to the world’s rich culture and creativity, therefore they made art museums our second home. I found myself captivated by the brushstrokes that painted stories on canvases and the intricate designs that whispered tales of innovation. It was during these early explorations that sparked a passion in me for art and design.</p>
      <p>Looking back at the vague memories that remain until this day, there is one that stands out, not just as a recollection but as an experience that I can still touch and feel. I find myself transported to a place where organic shapes and colors bring imagination to life. <br><img class="siblings" src="parque-guell.jpg"><br> As my 4-year-old-self steps through the mosaic-covered entrance, I enter a world where reality and fantasy meet. The ground between my feet is covered with broken tiles and ceramic shards, arranged to form patterns that seem to dance around me. The giant lizard sculpture guards the staircase, their colorful scales reflecting the light shining from the bright sun. These magical creatures seem frozen, inviting us to ascend into a realm where nature and art engage in harmony. The curvy benches along the path feel like something straight out of a storybook. I climb onto the curvy seating, feeling like I have become one with the curves of the architecture, playing hide and seek with nature. The columns look like the legs of friendly giants, as I imagine them coming to life, playing hide-and-seek with me. The whole place was a playground made by nature and Gaudi together. As the day ends, I wave goodbye to Gaudi’s world, a world that made me believe within the realm of creativity, anything was possible. The way each ceramic shard blended with the broken tiles was like a stroke of the brush, each exploration of form, became a journey of self-discovery. The nomadic rhythm of my life also allowed me to draw inspiration from all the different memories and cultures I was exposed to, infusing my artistic expression with a ride range of influences.</p>

      <p>One of my most memorable interactions with nature unfolded on a forgotten rooftop. In the midst of towering buildings, I stumbled upon a resilient pocket of greenery that became my secret hideout. One day, I found a fragile caterpillar wiggling its way across a potted plant, seemingly lost. Intrigued, I carefully scooped it up and created a makeshift habitat. Watching it transform into a vibrant butterfly was not just a childhood marvel but a subtle lesson in the delicate balance of life in the city. <br>

         <p>That encounter sparked a quiet commitment in me ¬– a realization that even in the concrete jungle, we could foster spaces for growth and transformation. It became a foundational experience, subtly influencing my design ethos to prioritize nurture and care for the overlooked, ensuring that even in the heart of the city, nature's transformative power is celebrated and preserved.</p>
      <p>Fast forward through the years, and my life’s been quite a journey through different countries, along with reality starting to creep up behind me. “What do you want to be when you grow up?” – a question we are all a bit too familiar with, yet I never had a definite answer.</p>
      <p>As the years unfolded, the question of my future, once daunting, gradually evolved into an exciting exploration, a journey of self-discovery that brought me to where I am today.</p>
