    <p>Growing up, my living space has been continually shaped by nature; propagations, terrariums and plants. A bedroom/green-house of sorts. Sometimes, I wonder why I have had this obsession, or let’s call it a hobby, with taking care of plants, and it has a lot to say with my way of working.  My relationship with nature has been one of awe and commitment. In my free time, I find myself contemplating and investigating the intricate ways in which nature works, understanding each of my individual plant’s needs to integrate better care. For instance, Monstera Deliciosas (swiss cheese plant) need lots of indirect light to thrive and Chlorophytum comosum (spider plant) shows a remarkable ability to reproduce and survive. It is evident that in my previous works during my Minerva career, I have always enjoyed working from understanding the core of how things work.</p>

    <p>My beloved deadbug radio project is a great example, where I began with researching each component, from buttons to transistors to capacitors. It makes more sense to me, in my way of working, to deeply understand a technique or concept before the execution. There is just so much to understand.</p>

    <p>In contemplating our relationship with nature, I find myself wrestling with the interplay of care and manipulation that is present in many different aspects of human life. Consider the simple act of nurturing house plants – an activity that seems mundane but brings joy to countless individuals, myself included. On the surface, it appears to be an expression of care, as we provide these domesticated plants with the necessary conditions for growth within our homes. Yet, beneath that same surface lies a more complex reality. The very act of bringing a plant indoors can be a form of manipulation, a subtle domestication that echoes a long history of humans shaping the natural world to fit our preferences.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This internal conflict arises from the separation between the genuine desire to care for something, living entities, and the realization that care often involves altering their natural habitat. As we embrace the responsibility of tending to nature, we unwittingly partake in a tradition of sculpting nature in a way that suits our human needs, blurring the lines between nurturing and reshaping.</p>
