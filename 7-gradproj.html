    <p>Initially, my ambition was set on building a Tamagotchi-style mushroom/crops incubator, with the idea of incorporating a fun and playful element to encourage interaction with the users. However, as mentioned in one of the earlier chapters, this led me to give thought to the significant dilemma – questioning the purpose behind creating such a growth chamber. Is it an act of caretaking, or does it veer into the realm of manipulation, designed solely to meet human needs? This internal dialogue redirected my project’s trajectory. </p>
    <p>Deciding to move away from the growth chamber wasn't just about steering clear of an extensive exploration into electronics and Arduino. More fundamentally, it came from the belief that my final graduation project should be a canvas for a more intricate and creative process.</p>

    <p><i>“Once we recognize ourselves, we begin to recognize our positions, and how our positions may be at the expense of others, be those others human or non-human. </p>
      
    <p>Once we recognize that we are placed in various systems in ways to keep us moving in place, we stop and then slowly realign our ways of experience, our praxis experiences radical change, one in which we might recognize decolonization as care.”</i>

    <p><strong id="question">How can we, as designers, become facilitators rather than controllers? Can we create frameworks that respect the autonomy of nature while providing a stage for its expression? The very act of designing becomes an act of humility, acknowledging that the wisdom of nature far exceeds our understanding.</strong>

    <p>It's a venture in coexistence, recognizing nature's influence while adding our creative touch to life's intricate canvas.It's an exploration of coexistence, recognizing nature's influence while adding our creative touch to life's intricate canvas. In this revised narrative, the graduation project becomes a tribute to collaboration, showcasing the subtle balance between design and nature. Manipulation boundaries fade as we explore merging human creativity with the unpredictable cadence of the natural world, potentially allowing nature to guide certain decision-making processes.
